    <h1>The School Of Hogwarts</h1>
    <h2>Recruitment</h2>
    <p>Each year, the Hogwarts Deputy Headmaster sends letters to eligible witches and wizards who will be eleven years old. These letters invite the children to be students at Hogwarts.
         If for any reason a letter does not reach its intended recipient, owls will continue delivering letters until the person receives one (as was Harry's experience when he turned eleven). The letter contains a list of needed supplies, signed by the Chief Attendant of Witchcraft Provisions, Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus, which includes uniform clothing, spell books, and cauldrons.
    Letters are also sent to existing students to inform them of the new supplies needed. Students usually obtain school supplies at Diagon Alley in London. <br>
    Letters to Muggle-born witches and wizards, such as Hermione and Harry's mother Lily Evans (and Tom Riddle (Voldemort) and Harry, though half-bloods, who lived with Muggles and knew nothing of the wizarding world), who may not be aware of their powers and are unfamiliar with the concealed wizarding world, are delivered in person by a member of Hogwarts staff, who then explain to the parents/guardians about magical society, and reassure them regarding this news.
     They also assist the family in regards to buying supplies and gaining access to Diagon Alley.</p>
    
     
        <h2>The School Grounds</h2>
    <p>
    Hogwarts School is located in Hogwarts Castle, a large castle somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland. The castle has extensive grounds with sloping lawns, flowerbeds and vegetable patches, a loch (called the Black Lake), a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch Pitch. 
     There is also an owlery, which houses all the owls owned by the school and those owned by students. <br>
     The three highest towers are the Astronomy, Ravenclaw, and Gryffindor ones. There are 142 staircases, which are known to move around in the massive castle which is set upon huge rocks above a magnificent lake.
      The castle is known for its many updates and changes in layout throughout the years, such as regenerating itself after the Battle of Hogwarts. It should be noted that some rooms in the school tend to "move around," and so do the steps on the Grand Staircase.
       Albus Dumbledore once noted that even he did not know all of Hogwarts' secrets. The castle has witnessed centuries and has a long history of ancient magic. <br>
       The school has numerous charms and spells on and around it that make it impossible for a Muggle to see it as the school; rather, they see only ruins and several warnings of danger.
        Witches and wizards cannot Apparate or Disapparate in Hogwarts grounds, except for when the Headmaster lifts the enchantment, whether only in certain areas or for the entire campus, so as to make the school less vulnerable when it serves the headmaster to allow Apparition.
         Electricity and electronic devices are not found at Hogwarts. A former student, 'Hermione Granger', indicated that due to the high levels of magic, substitutes for magic used by Muggles, such as computers, radar and electricity "go haywire" around Hogwarts.
          Radios, however, make an exception as they are not powered by electricity, but by magic. </p>
        <h2>Typical Day</h2>
        <p>The day begins at 7:30 a.m. with breakfast in the Great Hall. During breakfast, the mail arrives in a flurry of hundreds of owls. A bell chime signals the start of the first class at 9 a.m. The bell chimes again in one hour to signal the start of the next class.
            There are two class periods before lunch (though N.E.W.T. students may have breaks during some of these), scheduled according to house. After lunch, there is another break and two more classes.[20] If there is a heavy snowstorm in between periods, certain lessons that take place outside (such as Herbology) may be cancelled, since it would be difficult for students to traverse from the castle to the outside. 
            Dinner is served in the Great Hall toward evening, after which the students are expected to be in their house common rooms for studying and socialising.
            There is an Astronomy class at night on Wednesday every week (usually midnight). 
            The students must be in bed or in the common rooms by a certain time, after which is called after hours. The times are different for different years (for example, fifth years are allowed to be in the halls until 9:00 p.m.)</p>
        <h2>Class Years</h2>
        <p>The school host studentsthat are typically between the ages of 10 and 18 but exceptions 
            are made due to special circumstances or students being held back due to insufficient grades.
            There are 7 years in which students attend classes whith the main differences between them being:first years who learn flying,
            second years who may bring their and and no longer must take the train,
            3rd years: who can visit the naerby town and choose electives, fourth years similar to thirds except more intense,
            5th years take the O.W.L., 6th years the N.E.W.T. level classes, and 7th years who prepare to graduate
