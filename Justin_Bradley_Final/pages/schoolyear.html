        <h1>First Years and what you need to know</h1>
        <ul>
<li class="no">Hogwarts studies all potential students. If you recieve a letter by owl you have been accepted</li> <br>
<li class="no">Muggle students who have no knowledge of magic will be personally informed and pick up by a staff membber</li> <br>
<li class="no">There is no flying on campus for first years unless during flying class or quidditch matches</li> <br>
<li class="no">All students are allowed one familiar. A toad, a cat or an owl. Must ask permission for familiar not listed</li> <br>
<li class="no">Term begins on 1 September. Students usually reach Hogwarts via the Hogwarts Express, which leaves from Platform 9Â¾ of London's King's Cross Station at 11 a.m. sharp. There are other ways of entering the school, such as via broomsticks or Floo Powder, or simply Apparating to a nearby location such as Hogsmeade. Missing the Hogwarts Express for any reason is a very serious problem, but will not cost the student points as long as they get there before the term has officially started.
     The Hogwarts Express brings the students to Hogsmeade station, where the first years traditionally cross the Black Lake in boats with the gamekeeper, and go under an opening in the rocks upon which Hogwarts is built, through a curtain of ivy, and finally into an underground harbour.</li> <br>
<li class="no">All first years are sorted after the first grand banquet into houses</li> <br>
<li class="no">Homework is usually assigned to students at the end of classes or at the end of the school term. It is usually completed by students in the: Study Hall, Study Area, Library, Gryffindor Tower reading room or another common room. A homework planner can be used to help students to keep track of all their homework assignments. The planner also tells the students to complete the homework when it is opened. If a student fails to complete the homework or is late in handing it in, he/she could be given a detention as a punishment. </li> <br>
<li>Any other information needed will be given in syllabus at beginning of year or may be asked to faculty or upperclassmen</li>

        <h2> The Patronus Charm</h2>
        <p>This ancient and mysterious charm conjures a magical guardian, a projection of all your most positive feelings. <br>
         The Patronus Charm is difficult, and many witches and wizards are unable to produce a full, corporeal Patronus, a guardian which generally takes the shape of the animal with whom they share the deepest affinity. You may suspect, but you will never truly know what form your Patronus will take until you succeed in conjuring it."</p> <br>
        <p>A corporeal Patronus is one that is fully-formed, taking the shape of bright-white, translucent animal. The specific animal forms that corporeal Patronuses take vary from person to person and reflect each individual's innermost personality. Many will be tested on their affinity with the spell in their 3rd year</p>
