            <h1>Task Force X</h1>
            <b>There are dangerous tasks. Tasks that would risk the lives a proud and good americans and also which aren't exactly
                legal. But these are tasks that must be completed. That is why we must implement a new plan. We must put
                together a squad that is able to complete these tasks but have no issue with their deaths or getting rid
                of them when they learn too much. Which is why Director Waller is proposing to put together a team of criminals
                under her direct control to handle cases like these. And all we have to do is offer them time off their sentence
                to do them. The criminals that have rehabilitaed or easy to control are easy to find. getting them to do
                the task can be done with a few simple bombs and minor surgery. After this all we need to do is tell them
                when and where to go. We have could possibly have our own super powered team. below are the first few candidates
                that waller thinks is up to the task.</b>
